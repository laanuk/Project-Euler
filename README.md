Project-Euler
=============
Hello!

This is where I solve problems from the site called Project-Euler. I mostly pick and choose problems 
I think are interesting and code in Python or Java. All solutions are solely my own work and all, (with the exception of 1)
run within the time limits of Project Euler rules.

Feel free to contact me regarding any questions/concerns you may have.
